## How to Contribute
 
1. **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the project.
2. **Create a branch:** Start a new branch from the main branch for your work.
3. **Make changes:** Implement your feature or fix. Please ensure your code includes tests and necessary documentation.
4. **Follow commit guidelines:** Use the commit message format described below.
5. **Submit a Pull Request:** Clearly explain your changes and reference any related issues.
 
## Code of Conduct
 
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all. Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details on our expectations for participant behavior.
 
## Branching Model
 
- **Main Branch:** Contains the stable, production-ready code.
- **Feature Branches:** Create these from the main branch and name them appropriately (e.g., `feature/awesome-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue-123`).
 
## Commit Message Guidelines
 
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification with an additional requirement: **each commit message must include a scope** that reflects the part of the codebase being changed.
 
A commit message should be structured as follows:
 
> `<type>`(`<scope>`): `<subject>`
>  
> `<body>`

**Type**: Indicates the nature of the commit. Examples include:
 
```
feat (new feature)
 
fix (bug fix)
 
docs (documentation changes)
 
style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
 
refactor (code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature)
 
perf (performance improvements)
 
test (adding or correcting tests)
 
chore (maintenance, tooling changes)
```
 
**Scope**: A concise description (lower-case and without spaces) of the area affected (e.g., cnn, convolution, layer).
 
**Subject**: A brief description of the change.
 
**Body (optional)**: More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.
 
### Examples
 
feat(transformers): implement #propagate method in decoder
 
fix(vector): resolve error when providing null data to Tensor#of
 
docs(examples): update with latest XOR NN tutorial
 
## Submitting Pull Requests
